# Advanced GraphQL 

## Clients

### Caching
- data normalization
- globally unique IDs
 
### Colocation
- declarative data dependencies
- good kind of coupling

### UI Integration
- no low-level networking tasks
- data is declared and ends up in UI automatically


## Servers

### Resolvers
- "GraphQL endpoints"
- load correct data from the database

### Database Connectors
- GraphQL specific layer on top of DB

### GraphQL & Legacy Systems
- GraphQL layer in front of existing APIs


## Tooling & Ecosystem

### Reference Implementations
- <list of reference implementation & frameworks, e.g. graphql-js, sangria>

### Code Generation
- codegen based on schema

### Analytics & Monitoring
- fine-grained data access analytics on the server

### Introspection
- self-documenting APIs
- schema can be extracted with query


## Advanced GraphQL Concepts

### Advanced SDL Concepts
- object types and scalars
- special Query, Mutation and Subscription types
- enums
- union types / interfaces

### Fragments
- selection of fields on a type

### Variables
- arguments on fields

### Aliases
- naming query results

### Static Queries
- generate query IDs at build-time and save on server
- save upload data

## Common Questions
