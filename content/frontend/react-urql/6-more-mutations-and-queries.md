In this section of the tutorial you'll implement the voting feature! Authenticated users are allowed to submit a vote for a link. The most upvoted links will later be displayed on a separate route!

### Preparing the Link component

Once more, let's first prepare the app's components before implementing the actual upvote mutation. There's several things that the `Link` component isn't currently displaying, compared to the real Hackernews site.

- a link should display its number in the list of the current page (`1.`, `2.`, ...)
- it should display an upvote button and the number of upvotes it received
- it should display who posted the link
- and it should display when it was posted

Before you'll modify the `Link` component, let's write a function that takes a timestamp and converts it to a string that's more user friendly, e.g. `"3 hours ago"`.

<Instruction>

Create a new file called `dates.js` in the `src` directory and paste the following code into it:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/dates.js")
const timeDifference = (current, previous) => {
  const milliSecondsPerMinute = 60 * 1000
  const milliSecondsPerHour = milliSecondsPerMinute * 60
  const milliSecondsPerDay = milliSecondsPerHour * 24
  const milliSecondsPerMonth = milliSecondsPerDay * 30
  const milliSecondsPerYear = milliSecondsPerDay * 365

  const elapsed = current - previous

  if (elapsed < milliSecondsPerMinute / 3) {
    return 'just now'
  }

  if (elapsed < milliSecondsPerMinute) {
    return 'less than 1 min ago'
  } else if (elapsed < milliSecondsPerHour) {
    return Math.round(elapsed / milliSecondsPerMinute) + ' min ago'
  } else if (elapsed < milliSecondsPerDay) {
    return Math.round(elapsed / milliSecondsPerHour) + ' h ago'
  } else if (elapsed < milliSecondsPerMonth) {
    return Math.round(elapsed / milliSecondsPerDay) + ' days ago'
  } else if (elapsed < milliSecondsPerYear) {
    return Math.round(elapsed / milliSecondsPerMonth) + ' mo ago'
  } else {
    return Math.round(elapsed / milliSecondsPerYear) + ' years ago'
  }
}

export const timeDifferenceForDate = date => {
  const now = new Date().getTime()
  const updated = new Date(date).getTime()
  return timeDifference(now, updated)
}
```

</Instruction>

Now, let's update the `Link` component with everything that is has previously been missing!

<Instruction>

Open `Link.js` and update it to look as follows:

```js{2-3,5-6,8,12-19,24-30}(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/components/Link.js")
import React from 'react'
import { getToken } from '../token'
import { timeDifferenceForDate } from '../dates'

const Link = ({ index, link }) => {
  const isLoggedIn = !!getToken()
  
  const upvote = React.useCallback(() => {}, [])
  
  return (
    <div className="flex mt2 items-start">
      <div className="flex items-center">
        <span className="gray">{index + 1}.</span>
        {isLoggedIn && (
          <div className="ml1 gray f11" onClick={upvote}>
            â–²
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
      <div className="ml1">
        <div>
          {link.description} ({link.url})
        </div>
        <div className="f6 lh-copy gray">
          {link.votes.length} votes | by{' '}
          {link.postedBy
            ? link.postedBy.name
            : 'Unknown'}{' '}
          {timeDifferenceForDate(link.createdAt)}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Link
```

</Instruction>

As you can see, we've also added a new prop. Each `Link` element will also render its position inside the list, so you have to now pass it the `index` prop from the `LinkList` component.

<Instruction>

Open `LinkList.js` and update the rendering of the `Link` components inside its returned elements:

```js{6-8}(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/components/LinkList.js")
// const linksToRender = data.feed.links
// ...

return (
  <div>
    {linksToRender.map((link, index) => (
      <Link key={link.id} link={link} index={index} />
    ))}
  </div>
)
```

</Instruction>

Notice that the app won't run at the moment since the `votes` are not yet included in the query. You'll fix that next!

<Instruction>

Still in `LinkList.js`, update the definition of `FEED_QUERY` to look as follows:

```js{9-18}(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/components/LinkList.js")
const FEED_QUERY = gql`
  {
    feed {
      links {
        id
        createdAt
        url
        description
        postedBy {
          id
          name
        }
        votes {
          id
          user {
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

</Instruction>

All you do here is include information about the user who posted a link as well as information about each link's votes in the query's payload. You can now run the app again and the links will be ddisplayed properly.

> **Note**: If you're not able to fetch the links, restart the server and reload the browser. You could also check if everything is working as expected on `GraphQL Playground`!

### The Upvote Mutation

Let's now move on and implement the `vote` mutation!

<Instruction>

Open `Link.js` and add the following import statements and GraphQL mutation at the top:

```js{2-3,8}(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/components/Link.js")
import React from 'react'
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
import { useMutation } from 'urql'

import { getToken } from '../token'
import { timeDifferenceForDate } from '../dates

const VOTE_MUTATION = gql`
  mutation VoteMutation($linkId: ID!) {
    vote(linkId: $linkId) {
      link {
        id
        votes {
          id
          user {
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`

// ...
```

</Instruction>

When you've updated the `Link` component you also added an empty `upvote` handler. Let's now add the mutation and populate that handler with the usual logic, like you did back for the `Login` component in a previous step.

<Instruction>

Still in `Link.js`, implement the `useMutation` hook and update the `upvote` handler:

```js{4,6-10}(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/components/Link.js")
const Link = ({ index, link }) => {
  // ...

  const [state, executeMutation] = useMutation(VOTE_MUTATION);

  const upvote = React.useCallback(() => {
    if (!state.fetching) {
      executeMutation({ linkId: link.id });
    }
  }, [state.fetching, executeMutation, link.id]);
    
  // ...
};
```

</Instruction>

This step should feel pretty familiar by now. You're adding the new mutation inside of your component by adding the `useMutation` hook. You're also passing the `linkId` variable to `executeMutation`, since it's required by the `VoteMutation`'s definition.

You can now go ahead and test this! Run `yarn start` in `hackernews-react-urql`, make sure that you're logged in, then click the upvote button on a link. You should then see the link's upvote number update automatically!

> **Remember**: We haven't set up any configuration for `@urql/exchange-graphcache` yet, but since it's a normalized cache, it knows that the link it receives back from the mutation needs to also be updated on the feed query!

### Creating the Search page

Next up, you'll add a search page to your app!

The search will be available under a new route and allow you to filter all links that have been submitted to your GraphQL API.

<Instruction>

Start by creating a new file called `Search.js` in `src/components` and add the following code:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/components/Search.js")
import React from 'react'
import { useQuery } from 'urql'
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
import Link from './Link'

const Search = () => {
  const [filter, setFilter] = React.useState('')

  const search = React.useCallback(() => {}, []);
  const links = []
  
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        Search
        <input
          type='text'
          onChange={e => setFilter(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button onClick={search}>search</button>
      </div>
      {links.map((link, index) => (
        <Link key={link.id} link={link} index={index} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}

export default Search
```

</Instruction>

Again, this is a pretty standard setup. You're rendering an `input` field where the user can type a search string.

It's worth noting that this time we'd like to start the search imperatively. Instead of the `useQuery` hook starting the search immediately while the user is typing, we'd like to only start searching once the user clicks the "search" button.

For now the `search` handler and `links` array are also empty stubs, but we'll be replacing them in a later step.

<Instruction>

Add a new `/search` route to the app. Open `App.js` and update the routes to include the `Search` component:

```js{9,20}(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/components/App.js")
import React from 'react'
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom'

import LoadingBoundary from './LoadingBoundary'
import Header from './Header'
import LinkList from './LinkList'
import CreateLink from './CreateLink'
import Login from './Login'
import Search from './Search'

const App = () => (
  <div className="center w85">
    <Header />
    <div className="ph3 pv1 background-gray">
      <LoadingBoundary>
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" component={LinkList} />
          <Route exact path="/create" component={CreateLink} />
          <Route exact path="/login" component={Login} />
          <Route exact path="/search" component={Search} />
        </Switch>
      </LoadingBoundary>
    </div>
  </div>
)

export default App
```

</Instruction>

Let's also add a button to the header so users can comfortably navigate to the search page.

<Instruction>

Open `Header.js` and put a new `Link` between `new` and `submit`:

```js{9-12}(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/components/Header.js")
// ...

<div className="flex pa1 justify-between nowrap orange">
  <div className="flex flex-fixed black">
    <div className="fw7 mr1">Hacker News</div>
    <Link to="/" className="ml1 no-underline black">
      new
    </Link>
    <div className="ml1">|</div>
    <Link to="/search" className="ml1 no-underline black">
      search
    </Link>
    {isLoggedIn && (
      <div className="flex">
        <div className="ml1">|</div>
        <Link to="/create" className="ml1 no-underline black">
          submit
        </Link>
      </div>
    )}
  </div>
```

</Instruction>

You can now navigate to the search feature using the "search" button in the `Header`:

### The Search Query

Great, let's now go back to the `Search` component and implement the actual search!

<Instruction>

Open `Search.js` and add the following import statements and query definition at the top of the file:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/components/Search.js")
import gql from 'graphql-tag'
import { useQuery } from 'urql'

const FEED_SEARCH_QUERY = gql`
  query FeedSearchQuery($filter: String!) {
    feed(filter: $filter) {
      links {
        id
        url
        description
        createdAt
        postedBy {
          id
          name
        }
        votes {
          id
          user {
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`
```

</Instruction>

This query looks similar to the feed query that's used in `LinkList`. However, this time it takes in an argument called `filter` that will be used to constrain the list of links you want to retrieve.

Previously you've always just passed `useQuery` a query and some variables. But in the case of the new `Search` component, the query is meant to run programmatically, when the "search" button is clicked. You can utilise the `executeQuery` method and the `pause` argument to achieve this.

<Instruction>

Still in `Search.js`, add the `useQuery` hook to the `Search` component and replace the `search` handler and empty `links` array:

```js{4-8,10-12,14}(path=".../hackernews-react-urql/src/components/Search.js")
const Search = () => {
  const [filter, setFilter] = React.useState('')

  const [result, executeQuery] = useQuery({
    query: FEED_SEARCH_QUERY,
    variables: { filter },
    pause: true,
  })

  const search = React.useCallback(() => {
    executeQuery();
  }, [executeQuery]);
  
  const links = result.data ? result.data.feed.links : [];
    
  // ...
};
```

</Instruction>

Like in `LinkList` you're passing the query and variables arguments to `useQuery`. But instead of immediately running the query, the `pause` option is now set to `true`. This flag will cause `useQuery` to wait until `executeQuery` is programmatically called.

This is a very powerful option as you could also flip `pause` to `false` at any time to let the hook start the query automatically. This is essentially one of the use-cases of having `executeQuery`! You can call it programmatically to ask for new results or use it in combination with `pause: true` to make it behave like the `useMutation` hook's `executeMutation`.

Go ahead and test the app by running `yarn start` in a terminal and navigating to `http://localhost:3000/search`. Then type a search string into the text field, submit the search, and verify that the links that are being displayed were filtered by your search string.
