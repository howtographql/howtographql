In this section, we'll see how to implement authentication
with Apollo to provide signup and login features in our app.

### Prepare the React Components

As in the sections before, we'll set the stage for the login
functionality by preparing the React components that are
needed for this feature. We'll start by building the `Login`
component.

<Instruction>

Create a new file in `src/components` and call it
`Login.js`. Then paste the following code into it:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Login.js")
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';

const Login = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const [formState, setFormState] = useState({
    login: true,
    email: '',
    password: '',
    name: ''
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h4 className="mv3">
        {formState.login ? 'Login' : 'Sign Up'}
      </h4>
      <div className="flex flex-column">
        {!formState.login && (
          <input
            value={formState.name}
            onChange={(e) =>
              setFormState({
                ...formState,
                name: e.target.value
              })
            }
            type="text"
            placeholder="Your name"
          />
        )}
        <input
          value={formState.email}
          onChange={(e) =>
            setFormState({
              ...formState,
              email: e.target.value
            })
          }
          type="text"
          placeholder="Your email address"
        />
        <input
          value={formState.password}
          onChange={(e) =>
            setFormState({
              ...formState,
              password: e.target.value
            })
          }
          type="password"
          placeholder="Choose a safe password"
        />
      </div>
      <div className="flex mt3">
        <button
          className="pointer mr2 button"
          onClick={() => console.log('onClick')}
        >
          {formState.login ? 'login' : 'create account'}
        </button>
        <button
          className="pointer button"
          onClick={(e) =>
            setFormState({
              ...formState,
              login: !formState.login
            })
          }
        >
          {formState.login
            ? 'need to create an account?'
            : 'already have an account?'}
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Login;
```

</Instruction>

Let's quickly understand the structure of this new
component, which can have two major states:

- One state is **for users that already have an account**
  and only need to login. In this state, the component will
  only render two `input` fields for the user to provide
  their `email` and `password`. Notice that
  `formState.login` will be `true` in this case.
- The second state is for **users that haven't created an
  account yet**, and thus still need to sign up. Here, we
  render a third `input` field where users can provide their
  `name`. In this case, `formState.login` will be `false`.

In the `onClick` handler in the submit button, we'll
eventually call the appropriate mutations for these two
actions.

Next, we also need to provide the `constants.js` file that
we use to define the key for the credentials that we're
storing in the browser's `localStorage`.

<Instruction>

In `src`, create a new file called `constants.js` and add
the following definition:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/constants.js")
export const AUTH_TOKEN = 'auth-token';
```

</Instruction>

With that component in place, we can add a new route to our
routing setup.

<Instruction>

Open `App.js` and update it to include the new route:

```js{16}(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/App.js")
// ...
import Login from './Login';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="center w85">
      <Header />
      <div className="ph3 pv1 background-gray">
        <Routes>
          <Route path="/" element={<LinkList/>} />
          <Route
            path="/create"
            element={<CreateLink/>}
          />
          <Route path="/login" element={<Login/>} />
        </Routes>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

</Instruction>

Add a `Link` to the `Header` to allow users to navigate to
the `Login` page.

<Instruction>

Open `Header.js` and update `render` to look as follows:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Header.js")
import React from 'react';
import { Link, useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { AUTH_TOKEN } from '../constants';

const Header = () => {
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  const authToken = localStorage.getItem(AUTH_TOKEN);
  return (
    <div className="flex pa1 justify-between nowrap orange">
      <div className="flex flex-fixed black">
        <Link to="/" className="no-underline black">
          <div className="fw7 mr1">Hacker News</div>
        </Link>           
        <Link to="/" className="ml1 no-underline black">
          new
        </Link>
        <div className="ml1">|</div>
        <Link
          to="/search"
          className="ml1 no-underline black"
        >
          search
        </Link>
        {authToken && (
          <div className="flex">
            <div className="ml1">|</div>
            <Link
              to="/create"
              className="ml1 no-underline black"
            >
              submit
            </Link>
          </div>
        )}
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-fixed">
        {authToken ? (
          <div
            className="ml1 pointer black"
            onClick={() => {
              localStorage.removeItem(AUTH_TOKEN);
              navigate(`/`);
            }}
          >
            logout
          </div>
        ) : (
          <Link
            to="/login"
            className="ml1 no-underline black"
          >
            login
          </Link>
        )}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Header;
```

</Instruction>

We first retrieve the `authToken` from local storage. If the
`authToken` is not available, the **submit** button won't be
rendered. This way, we can make sure only authenticated
users can create new links.

We're also adding a second button to the right of the
`Header` that users can use to login and logout.

Here is what the ready component looks like:

![The Header component](https://imgur.com/FsHxKnu.png)

Perfect, we're all set to implement the authentication
functionality.

### Using the authentication mutations

`signup` and `login` are two regular GraphQL mutations we
can use in the same way as we did with the `createLink`
mutation from before.

<Instruction>

Open `Login.js` and add the following two definitions to the
top of the file:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Login.js")
const SIGNUP_MUTATION = gql`
  mutation SignupMutation(
    $email: String!
    $password: String!
    $name: String!
  ) {
    signup(
      email: $email
      password: $password
      name: $name
    ) {
      token
    }
  }
`;

const LOGIN_MUTATION = gql`
  mutation LoginMutation(
    $email: String!
    $password: String!
  ) {
    login(email: $email, password: $password) {
      token
    }
  }
`;
```

</Instruction>

Both mutations look very similar to the mutations we've
already seen. They take a number of arguments and return the
`token` that we can attach to subsequent requests to
authenticate the user (i.e. indicate that a request is made
_on behalf_ of that user). You'll learn ðŸ”œ how to do so.

<Instruction>

Next, find the `div` element that has the class names
`flex mt3` and replace it with the following:

```js{4}(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Login.js")
<div className="flex mt3">
  <button
    className="pointer mr2 button"
    onClick={formState.login ? login : signup}
  >
    {formState.login ? 'login' : 'create account'}
  </button>
  <button
    className="pointer button"
    onClick={(e) =>
      setFormState({
        ...formState,
        login: !formState.login
      })
    }
  >
    {formState.login
      ? 'need to create an account?'
      : 'already have an account?'}
  </button>
</div>
```

</Instruction>

The `onClick` event on the "login"/"create account" button
uses a ternary to call one of two functions: `login` or
`signup`. As the names imply, these functions will run
mutations to log the user in or sign them up for a new
account. Let's put in the `useMutation` hook to make these
actions happen.

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Login.js")
const [login] = useMutation(LOGIN_MUTATION, {
  variables: {
    email: formState.email,
    password: formState.password
  },
  onCompleted: ({ login }) => {
    localStorage.setItem(AUTH_TOKEN, login.token);
    navigate('/');
  }
});

const [signup] = useMutation(SIGNUP_MUTATION, {
  variables: {
    name: formState.name,
    email: formState.email,
    password: formState.password
  },
  onCompleted: ({ signup }) => {
    localStorage.setItem(AUTH_TOKEN, signup.token);
    navigate('/');
  }
});
```

These two mutations use the `useMutation` hook from Apollo.
They accept the GraphQL mutation documents we defined
earlier and accept variables from the form. The
`onCompleted` callback sets the user's token in local
storage and redirects them to the home page afterward.

<Instruction>

Still in `Login.js`, add the following imports to the top of
the file:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Login.js")
import { useMutation, gql } from '@apollo/client';
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
import { AUTH_TOKEN } from '../constants';
```

</Instruction>

We can now create an account by providing a `name`, `email`
and `password`. Once we do that, the **submit** button will
be rendered again:

![Create an account providing a name and email](https://imgur.com/bFPDTg2.png)

If you haven't done so before, go ahead and test the login
functionality. Run `yarn start` and open
`http://localhost:3000/login`. Then click the **need to
create an account?** button and provide some user data for
the user you're creating. Finally, click the **create
account** button. If all went well, the app navigates back
to the home route and the user was created. We can verify
that the new user is there by sending the `users` query in
the **dev** Playground in the **database** project.

### Configuring Apollo with the authentication token

Now that users are able to log in and obtain a token that
authenticates them against the GraphQL server, we need to
make sure that the token gets attached to all requests that
are sent to the API.

Since all the API requests are actually created and sent by
the `ApolloClient` instance at the root of our app, we need
to make sure it knows about the user's token! Luckily,
Apollo provides a nice way for authenticating all requests
by using the concept of
[middleware](http://dev.apollodata.com/react/auth.html#Header),
implemented as an
[Apollo Link](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link).

<Instruction>

Open `index.js` and put the following code _between_ the
creation of the `httpLink` and the instantiation of
`ApolloClient`:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/index.js")
const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {
  const token = localStorage.getItem(AUTH_TOKEN);
  return {
    headers: {
      ...headers,
      authorization: token ? `Bearer ${token}` : ''
    }
  };
});
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Before moving on, we need to import the Apollo dependencies.
Add the following to the top of `index.js`:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/index.js")
import { setContext } from '@apollo/client/link/context';
```

</Instruction>

This middleware will be invoked every time `ApolloClient`
sends a request to the server. Apollo Links allow us to
create `middlewares` that modify requests before they are
sent to the server.

Let's see how it works in our code: first, we get the
authentication `token` from `localStorage` if it exists;
after that, we return the `headers` to the `context` so
`httpLink` can read them.

> **Note**: You can read more about Apollo's authentication
> [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/networking/authentication/).

<Instruction>

We also need to make sure `ApolloClient` gets instantiated
with the correct link - update the constructor call as
follows:

```js{2}(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/index.js")
const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: authLink.concat(httpLink),
  cache: new InMemoryCache()
});
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Then directly import the key we need to retrieve the token
from `localStorage` on top of the same file:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/index.js")
import { AUTH_TOKEN } from './constants';
```

</Instruction>

That's it - now all our API requests will be authenticated
if a `token` is available.

### Requiring authentication on the server-side

The last thing we might do in this chapter is check how to
ensure only authenticated users are able to `post` new
links. Plus, every `Link` that's created by a `post`
mutation should automatically set the `User` who sent the
request for its `postedBy` field.

In our case, we're allowing `Link`s without an associated
`User` to be submitted. This is for the sake of
demonstration and may not be what you want for your own
application. We can get a sense of how this works if we look
at the server code in `Mutation.js`.

<Instruction>

Open `/server/src/resolvers/Mutation.js` and give a look how
it was implemented:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/server/src/resolvers/Mutation.js")
async function post(parent, args, context, info) {
  const { userId } = context;

  let postedBy = undefined
  if (userId) {
    postedBy = { connect: { id: userId } }
  }

  const newLink = await context.prisma.link.create({
    data: {
      url: args.url,
      description: args.description,
      postedBy
    }
  });
  
  context.pubsub.publish('NEW_LINK', newLink);  // not important for now

  return newLink;
}
```

</Instruction>

In this code block, we're extracting the `userId` from the
`context` object of the request and using it to directly
[`connect`](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/relation-queries)
it with the `Link` that's created using the `postedBy` relation. The `userId` is placed on
`context` by extracting it from the `Authorization` header
when we set up the server context in `index.js`. 

When creating posts without logging in, the `Authorization` header is not provided, then `userId` will be absent. In this case, `postedBy` will also be undefined and will be ignored by Prisma.
