There are two top-level operation types in GraphQL: queries
and mutations.

Queries are used when we want to read data.

Mutations are used when we want to change data. We use
mutations when we want to create, update, or delete records.

In this section, we'll learn how to send mutations with
Apollo. Doing so is actually not that much different than
sending queries and follows similar steps.

1. Write the mutation as a JavaScript constant using the
   `gql` parser function
1. Use the `useMutation` hook provided by Apollo Client to
   send mutations to our GraphQL server
1. Read the result of the mutation

### Preparing the React components

Like before, let's start by writing the React component
where users will be able to add new links.

<Instruction>

Create a new file in the `src/components` directory and call
it `CreateLink.js`. Then paste the following code into it:

```js{6}(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/CreateLink.js")
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const CreateLink = () => {
  const [formState, setFormState] = useState({
    description: '',
    url: ''
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
        }}
      >
        <div className="flex flex-column mt3">
          <input
            className="mb2"
            value={formState.description}
            onChange={(e) =>
              setFormState({
                ...formState,
                description: e.target.value
              })
            }
            type="text"
            placeholder="A description for the link"
          />
          <input
            className="mb2"
            value={formState.url}
            onChange={(e) =>
              setFormState({
                ...formState,
                url: e.target.value
              })
            }
            type="text"
            placeholder="The URL for the link"
          />
        </div>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    </div>
  );
};

export default CreateLink;
```

</Instruction>

This is a standard setup for a React component with two
`input` fields where users can provide the `url` and
`description` of the `Link` they want to create. The data
that's typed into these fields is held in the component's
local state by way of the `useState` hook.

### Writing the mutation

Our job now is to take the user input and send it as
arguments in a GraphQL mutation.

First, we need to define the mutation in our JavaScript code
and use the `useMutation` hook to fire the mutation.

<Instruction>

In `CreateLink.js`, add the following statement to the top
of the file:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/CreateLink.js")
import { useMutation, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const CREATE_LINK_MUTATION = gql`
  mutation PostMutation(
    $description: String!
    $url: String!
  ) {
    post(description: $description, url: $url) {
      id
      createdAt
      url
      description
    }
  }
`;
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Next, pass the `CREATE_LINK_MUTATION` to the `useMutation`
hook and pass in the data provided in the input fields as
variables.

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/CreateLink.js")
const CreateLink = () => {
  // ...
  const [createLink] = useMutation(CREATE_LINK_MUTATION, {
    variables: {
      description: formState.description,
      url: formState.url
    }
  });
  // ...
};
```

</Instruction>

When we use the `useMutation` hook, we need to destructure
out a function that can be used to call the mutaton. That's
what `createLink` is in the code block above. We're now free
to call the function whenever we need to when the component
renders.

Make a call to `createLink` in the `onSubmit` event on the
`form` tag.

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/CreateLink.js")
return (
  <div>
    <form
      onSubmit={(e) => {
        e.preventDefault();
        createLink();
      }}
    >
      ...
    </form>
  </div>
);
```

<Instruction>

We're now ready to check wether the mutations are working.
Open `App.js` and change it up as follows:

```js{2,6}(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/App.js")
import React from 'react';
import CreateLink from './CreateLink';
import LinkList from './LinkList';

const App = () => {
  return <CreateLink />;
};

export default App;
```

</Instruction>

Now, when we run `yarn start`, we should see the following:

![Running yarn start](https://imgur.com/FBEyWMp.png)

Two input fields and a **Submit** button - not very pretty
but functional.

Enter some data into the fields, e.g.:

- **Description**: `The best learning resource for GraphQL`
- **URL**: `howtographql.com`

Then click the **Submit** button. You won't get any visual
feedback in the UI, but let's see if the query actually
worked by checking the current list of links in a
Playground.

You can open a Playground again by navigating to
`http://localhost:4000` in your browser. Then send the
following query:

```graphql
# Try to write the query here
{
  feed {
    links {
      description
      url
    }
  }
}
```

You'll see the following server response:

```js(nocopy)
{
  "data": {
    "feed": {
      "links": [
        // ...
        {
          "description": "The best learning resource for GraphQL",
          "url": "howtographql.com"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Awesome! The mutation works, great job! ðŸ’ª
