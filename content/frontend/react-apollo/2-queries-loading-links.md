### Preparing the React components

The first piece of functionality we'll implement in the app
is loading and displaying a list of `Link` elements. We'll
walk up our way in the React component hierarchy and start
with the component that will render a single link.

<Instruction>

Create a new file called `Link.js` in the `components`
directory and add the following code:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Link.js")
import React from 'react';

const Link = (props) => {
  const { link } = props;
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        {link.description} ({link.url})
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Link;
```

</Instruction>

This is a simple React component that expects a `link` in
its `props` and renders the link's `description` and `url`.
Easy as pie! üç∞

Next, let's implement the component that renders a list of
links.

<Instruction>

Again, in the `components` directory, go ahead and create a
new file called `LinkList.js`. Then add the following code:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/LinkList.js")
import React from 'react';
import Link from './Link';

const LinkList = () => {
  const linksToRender = [
    {
      id: 'link-id-1',
      description:
        'Prisma gives you a powerful database toolkit üòé',
      url: 'https://prisma.io'
    },
    {
      id: 'link-id-2',
      description: 'The best GraphQL client',
      url: 'https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/'
    }
  ];

  return (
    <div>
      {linksToRender.map((link) => (
        <Link key={link.id} link={link} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default LinkList;
```

</Instruction>

Here, we're using local mock data for now to make sure the
component setup works. We'll soon replace this with some
actual data loaded from the server - patience, young
Padawan!

<Instruction>

To complete the setup, open `App.js` and replace the current
contents with the following:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/App.js")
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import LinkList from './LinkList';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return <LinkList />;
  }
}

export default App;
```

</Instruction>

Run the app to check if everything works so far! The app
should now display the two links from the `linksToRender`
array:

### Writing the GraphQL query

Let's now load the actual links that are stored in the
database. The first thing we need to do for that is define
the GraphQL query we want to send to the API.

Here is what it looks like:

```graphql
{
  feed {
    id
    links {
      id
      createdAt
      description
      url
    }
  }
}
```

We could now simply execute this query in a
[Playground](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground)
(against the _application schema_) and retrieve the results
from the GraphQL server. But how can we use it inside our
JavaScript code?

### Queries with Apollo Client

The most common (and probably the most flexible) way of
making queries with Apollo Client is to use the `useQuery`
hook it provides. With the `useQuery` hook, all we need to
do is pass a GraphQL query document in and Apollo will take
care of the fetching and will surface the returned data and
any errors for us.

Open up `LinkList.js` and add the query to the top of the
file:

```js{3-18}(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/LinkList.js")
import React from 'react';
import Link from './Link';
import { useQuery, gql } from '@apollo/client';

const FEED_QUERY = gql`
  {
    feed {
      id
      links {
        id
        createdAt
        url
        description
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

</Instruction>
<Instruction>

Next, instead of iterating over the hardcoded
`linksToRender` array, pass the `FEED_QUERY` query document
into `useQuery` and iterate over the returned links.

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/LinkList.js")
const LinkList = () => {
  const { data } = useQuery(FEED_QUERY);

  return (
    <div>
      {data && (
        <>
          {data.feed.links.map((link) => (
            <Link key={link.id} link={link} />
          ))}
        </>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

</Instruction>

Let's take a moment to walk through what's happening with
this new code.

The `FEED_QUERY` variable uses `gql`, a library that uses
[tagged template literals](https://wesbos.com/tagged-template-literals)
to parse the GraphQL query document we define. This query
document is then passed into the `useQuery` hook in the
`LinkList` component.

This hook returns three items that are relevant for our
purposes at this point:

1. `loading`: Is `true` as long as the request is still
   ongoing and the response hasn't been received.
1. `error`: In case the request fails, this field will
   contain information about what exactly went wrong.
1. `data`: This is the actual data that was received from
   the server. It has the `links` property which represents
   a list of `Link` elements.

> The injected props actually contain even more
> functionality. You can read more in the
> [API overview](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/essentials/queries.html#render-prop).

When the `LinkList` component initially renders, there won't
be any information on the `data` variable. For this reason,
we need to check that `data` is truthy before trying to
render any of the links that will come out of it. Once our
GraphQL request resolves with some data, the `LinkList`
component will re-render and `data` will be truthy. Our
links are available on `data.feed.links` which we can map
over to render.

That's it! You should see the exact same screen as before.
