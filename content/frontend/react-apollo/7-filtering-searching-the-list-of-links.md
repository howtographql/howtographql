In this section, we'll implement a search feature and learn
about the filtering capabilities of our GraphQL API.

### Preparing the React components

The search will be available under a new route and
implemented in a new React component.

<Instruction>

Start by creating a new file called `Search.js` in
`src/components` and add the following code:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Search.js")
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useLazyQuery } from '@apollo/client';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import Link from './Link';

const Search = () => {
  const [searchFilter, setSearchFilter] = useState('');
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        Search
        <input
          type="text"
          onChange={(e) => setSearchFilter(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button>OK</button>
      </div>
      {data &&
        data.feed.links.map((link, index) => (
          <Link key={link.id} link={link} index={index} />
        ))}
    </>
  );
};

export default Search;
```

</Instruction>

Again, this is a pretty standard setup. You're rendering an
`input` field where the user can type a search string.

The `Search` component uses the `useState` hook to hold a
search term supplied by the user. The `setSearchFilter`
functions is called in the `onChange` event on the input to
update this value.

The component is also looking for a variable called `data`
which it iterates over to render `Link` components with the
search results. We'll define and execute the query a bit
later.

<Instruction>

Let's now add the `Search` component as a new route to the
app. Open `App.js` and update it to look as follows:

```js{18}(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/App.js")
const App = () => (
  <div className="center w85">
    <Header />
    <div className="ph3 pv1 background-gray">
      <Switch>
        <Route
          exact
          path="/"
          render={() => <Redirect to="/new/1" />}
        />

        <Route
          exact
          path="/create"
          component={CreateLink}
        />
        <Route exact path="/login" component={Login} />
        <Route exact path="/search" component={Search} />
      </Switch>
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Also import the `Search` component at the top of the file:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/App.js")
import Search from './Search';
```

</Instruction>

For the user to be able to comfortably navigate to the
search functionality, let's also add a new navigation item
to the `Header`.

<Instruction>

Open `Header.js` and put a new `Link` between `new` and
`submit`:

```js{6-9}(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Header.js")
<div className="flex flex-fixed black">
  <div className="fw7 mr1">Hacker News</div>
  <Link to="/" className="ml1 no-underline black">
    new
  </Link>
  <div className="ml1">|</div>
  <Link to="/search" className="ml1 no-underline black">
    search
  </Link>
  {authToken && (
    <div className="flex">
      <div className="ml1">|</div>
      <Link to="/create" className="ml1 no-underline black">
        submit
      </Link>
    </div>
  )}
</div>
```

</Instruction>

We can now navigate to the search feature using the new
button in the `Header`:

Great, let's now go back to the `Search` component and see
how we can implement the actual search.

### Filtering Links

<Instruction>

Open `Search.js` and add the following query definition at
the top of the file:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Search.js")
const FEED_SEARCH_QUERY = gql`
  query FeedSearchQuery($filter: String!) {
    feed(filter: $filter) {
      id
      links {
        id
        url
        description
        createdAt
        postedBy {
          id
          name
        }
        votes {
          id
          user {
            id
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;
```

</Instruction>

This query looks similar to the `feed` query that's used in
`LinkList`. However, this time it takes in an argument
called `filter` that will be used to constrain the list of
links we want to retrieve.

The actual filter is built and used in the `feed` resolver
which is implemented in `server/src/resolvers/Query.js`:

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/server/src/resolvers/Query.js"&nocopy)
async function feed(parent, args, context, info) {
  const where = args.filter
    ? {
        OR: [
          { description: { contains: args.filter } },
          { url: { contains: args.filter } }
        ]
      }
    : {};

  const links = await context.prisma.link.findMany({
    where,
    skip: args.skip,
    take: args.take,
    orderBy: args.orderBy
  });

  const count = await context.prisma.link.count({ where });

  return {
    id: 'main-feed',
    links,
    count
  };
}

module.exports = {
  feed
};
```

In this case, two `where` conditions are specified: A link
is only returned if either its `url` contains the provided
`filter` _or_ its `description` contains the provided
`filter`. Both conditions are combined using Prisma's `OR`
operator.

Perfect, the query is defined! But this time we actually
want to load the data every time the user hits the **OK**
button, not upon the initial load of the component. To do
this, we'll use a hook supplied by Apollo called
`useLazyQuery`. This hook performs a query in the same way
the `useQuery` hook does but the difference is that it must
be executed manually. This is perfect for our situation––we
want to execute the query when the **OK** button is clicked.

Let's include `useLazyQuery` and execute it when the **OK**
button is clicked.

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Search.js")
const Search = () => {
  const [searchFilter, setSearchFilter] = useState('');
  const [executeSearch, { data }] = useLazyQuery(
    FEED_SEARCH_QUERY
  );
  return (
    <>
      <div>
        Search
        <input
          type="text"
          onChange={(e) => setSearchFilter(e.target.value)}
        />
        <button
          onClick={() =>
            executeSearch({
              variables: { filter: searchFilter }
            })
          }
        >
          OK
        </button>
      </div>
      {data &&
        data.feed.links.map((link, index) => (
          <Link key={link.id} link={link} index={index} />
        ))}
    </>
  );
};
```

We'll want to be sure to import `useLazyQuery` at the top of
the file.

```js(path=".../hackernews-react-apollo/src/components/Search.js")
import { useLazyQuery } from '@apollo/client';
```

The implementation is almost trivial! We're executing the
`FEED_SEARCH_QUERY` manually and retrieving the `links` from
the response that's returned by the server. These links are
put into the component's `state` so that they can be
rendered.

Go ahead and test the app by running `yarn start` in a
terminal and navigating to `http://localhost:3000/search`.
Then type a search string into the text field, click the
**OK** button and verify the links that are returned fit the
filter conditions.
