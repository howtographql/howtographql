In this tutorial, you learned how to build a fully-featured Hackernews clone with React and [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/). You implemented several features, such as displaying a list of links, signup and authentication, creating new links, voting on links, pagination as well as realtime updates with GraphQL subscriptions. For a longer tutorial that covers more advanced features of Apollo Client, check out the [GraphQL Guide](https://graphql.guide/).

To learn how to build the backend that you used for this tutorial, check out the [Node.JS tutorial](https://www.howtographql.com/graphql-js/0-introduction/).

The backend was powered by [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga), a fast and simple GraphQL server library built on top of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.

The resolvers of your GraphQL server are implemented using the Prisma client that's responsible for database access.
