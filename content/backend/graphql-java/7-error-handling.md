title: Error Handling
description: Get to know different kinds of errors and how they are typically handled with GraphQL

At this point, it is likely you've already seen an error showing up Graph*i*QL, so you probably have some intuition as to what happens when something goes wrong on the server. In the simplest case, if you just mistype a query you'll see an error popping up in the dedicated `errors` field in the response.

GraphQL puts an accent on consistency and predictability and, in that tone, the response from a GraphQL server always has a predictable structure, consisting the 3 fields:

* The `data` field, where the result of the operation is stored
* The `errors` field, where all the errors accumulated during the execution of the operation are kept
* An optional `extensions` field with arbitrary contents, usually meta-data about the response

Any GraphQL server will automatically handle syntactical and validation errors and inform the client appropriately, but the exceptions encountered in the resolver functions usually require application-specific handling. With your current stack, error handling can be customized on a few different levels.

At the highest level, `graphql-java-servlet` exposes a method (called `isClientError`) that decides whether an error's message is to be sent to the client verbatim or if it is to be obscured by a generic *server error* message. By default, only syntactical and validation errors will be sent as they are. This is a reasonable default, as exception messages and stack traces can potentially reveal a lot of information best kept hidden from public view. Yet, non-informative error messages (or even too numerous messages) can have severe negative impact on the API's usability.

Check out the default behavior in Graph*i*QL by first asking for an non-existent `address` field of a link:

Then check out the behavior for application-specific errors by, for example, providing a wrong password to `signinUser`:

To allow the user to properly sanitize outgoing messages, while keeping them relevant and specific, `graphql-java-servlet` exposes another extension point: the `GraphQLServlet#filterGraphQLErrors` method. By overriding this method it is possible to sanitize, filter, wrap or otherwise transform the collected errors before they're sent to the client.

One good use-case is enriching the messages with extra information useful to the client.

<Instruction>

To forward the data-fetching exception messages, while still hiding the corresponding stack traces, you should start by creating a simple wrapper class:

```java(path=".../hackernews-graphql-java/src/main/java/com/howtographql/hackernews/SanitizedError.java")
import com.fasterxml.jackson.annotation.JsonIgnore;
import graphql.ExceptionWhileDataFetching;

public class SanitizedError extends ExceptionWhileDataFetching {
    
    public SanitizedError(ExceptionWhileDataFetching inner) {
        super(inner.getException());
    }

    @Override
    @JsonIgnore
    public Throwable getException() {
        return super.getException();
    }
}
```

</Instruction>

This wrapper doesn't do much - it just instructs [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) (the JSON (de)serialization library) to ignore the linked exception during serialization. This way, the stack trace won't reach the client.

<Instruction>

Then, wrap all data-fetching exceptions by overriding `filterGraphQLErrors` in `GraphQLEndpoint`:

```java(path=".../hackernews-graphql-java/src/main/java/com/howtographql/hackernews/GraphQLEndpoint.java")
@Override
protected List<GraphQLError> filterGraphQLErrors(List<GraphQLError> errors) {
    return errors.stream()
            .filter(e -> e instanceof ExceptionWhileDataFetching || super.isClientError(e))
            .map(e -> e instanceof ExceptionWhileDataFetching ? new SanitizedError((ExceptionWhileDataFetching) e) : e)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
}
```

</Instruction>

This way, in addition to the syntactical and validation errors, data-fetching errors will have precise messages sent to the client, but without the gritty details. All other error types will still be hidden behind a generic message.

As always, verify your work in Graph*i*QL:

For even lower-level control, it is possible to customize the execution strategy (the way the operations are executed, modeled by the `ExecutionStrategy` interface), and  override `ExecutionStrategy#handleDataFetchingException` method which translates Java exceptions into GraphQL errors.

To use a custom execution strategy, change `GraphQLEndpoint`'s constructor to some like:

```java(nocopy)
public GraphQLEndpoint() {
    super(buildSchema(), new CustomExecutionStrategy());
} 
```
