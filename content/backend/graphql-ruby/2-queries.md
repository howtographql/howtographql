### Setup Links

In order to be able to show all links, you first need to set up your database so the links can be stored.

<Instruction>

Use the following command to generate the link database model:

```bash
bundle exec rails generate model Link url:string description:text
bundle exec rails db:migrate
```

</Instruction>

This generates a `link.rb` file in `app/models` that will look as follows:

```ruby(path=".../graphql-ruby/app/models/link.rb")
class Link < ApplicationRecord
end
```

This is our `link` model.

<Instruction>

Run `rails console` and then create a couple of dummy Links:

```ruby
Link.create url: 'http://graphql.org/', description: 'The Best Query Language'
Link.create url: 'http://dev.apollodata.com/', description: 'Awesome GraphQL Client'
exit
```

</Instruction>

Awesome! You now have a database table to store the links and a few dummy records setup.

### Query for Returning Links

Now, go ahead and define your [GraphQL Type](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/) for links. [GraphQL Ruby](http://graphql-ruby.org/guides) uses a [DSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) for that.


<Instruction>

Run the following command:

```bash
rails g graphql:object LinkType id:ID! url:String! description:String!
```

</Instruction>

This creates the file `app/graphql/types/link_type.rb` with the following content:

```ruby(path=".../graphql-ruby/blob/master/app/graphql/types/link_type.rb")
module Types
  class LinkType < BaseObject
    field :id, ID, null: false
    field :url, String, null: false
    field :description, String, null: false
  end
end
```

### Query Resolver

The type is now defined, but the server still doesn't know how to handle it. To fix that, you will now write your first **[resolver](http://graphql.org/learn/execution/#root-fields-resolvers)**. Resolvers are functions that the GraphQL server uses to fetch the data for a specific query. Each *field* of your GraphQL types needs a corresponding resolver function. When a query arrives at the backend, the server will call those resolver functions that correspond to the fields that are specified in the query.

All [GraphQL queries](http://graphql.org/learn/queries/) start from a root type called **[Query](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/#the-query-and-mutation-types)**.

When you previously ran `rails generate graphql:install`, it created the root query type in `app/graphql/types/query_type.rb` for you.

<Instruction>

Now update its content to:

```ruby(path=".../graphql-ruby/app/graphql/types/query_type.rb")
module Types
  class QueryType < BaseObject
    # queries are just represented as fields
    # `all_links` is automatically camelcased to `allLinks`
    field :all_links, [LinkType], null: false

    # this method is invoked, when `all_link` fields is being resolved
    def all_links
      Link.all
    end
  end
end
```

</Instruction>

Fields can be resolved in one of two ways:

* method on the type (named as the field), which accepts arguments and can access `object` and `context`
* [GraphQL::Schema::Resolver](https://graphql-ruby.org/api-doc/1.8.13/GraphQL/Schema/Resolver) - we are going to discuss those in the next chapter

### Testing With Playground

It's time to check what you've done so far! For this, you'll use [GraphiQL](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql), an in-browser IDE for running GraphQL queries.

GraphiQL had already been added to your application when you executed `rails generate graphql:install` in the terminal before, but you have to tell the asset pipeline to precompile its assets. Add this at the end of `/app/assets/config/manifest.js`:

```js
//= link graphiql/rails/application.css
//= link graphiql/rails/application.js
```

Open your browser at http://localhost:3000/graphiql

You'll see a nice IDE that looks like this:

![Browser open to localhost:4000/graphiql](http://i.imgur.com/EZIVYxP.png)

Click on the **Docs** link at the upper right to see a generated documentation of your schema. You'll see the `Query` type there, and clicking it will show you the new `allLinks` field, exactly as you've defined it. The documentation in GraphiQL is generated automatically based on your schema. This works thanks to a mechanism called [Introspection](http://graphql.org/learn/introspection/).

Try it out! On the left-most text box, type a simple query for listing all links and hit the **Play** button. This is what you'll see:

You can play around as much as you want with this tool. It makes testing GraphQL APIs so fun and easy, you'll never want to live without it any more. ðŸ˜Ž
