In this section, you're going to connect your GraphQL server with the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) database service which provides the interface to your database. The connection is implemented via [Prisma bindings](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma-binding).

### Updating the resolver functions to use Prisma bindings

You're going to start this section with a bit of cleanup and refactoring.

<Instruction>

Open `index.js` and entirely remove the `links` array as well as the `idCount` variable - you don't need those any more since the data will now be stored in an actual database.

</Instruction>

Next, you need to update the implementation of the resolver functions because they're now accessing variables that don't exist. Plus, you now want to return actual data from the database instead of local dummy data.

<Instruction>

Still in `index.js`, update the `resolvers` object to look as follows:

```js{4-6,8-17}(path=".../hackernews-node/src/index.js")
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    info: () => `This is the API of a Hackernews Clone`,
    feed: (root, args, context, info) => {
      return context.db.query.links({}, info)
    },
  },
  Mutation: {
    post: (root, args, context, info) => {
      return context.db.mutation.createLink({
        data: {
          url: args.url,
          description: args.description,
        },
      }, info)
    },
  },
}
```

</Instruction>

Wow, that looks weird! There's a bunch of new stuff happening, let's try to understand what's going on, starting with the `feed` resolver.

#### The `context` and `info` arguments

Previously, the `feed` resolver didn't take any arguments - now it receives _four_. In fact, the first two are not needed. But `context` and `info` are.

Remember how we said earlier that all GraphQL resolver functions _always_ receive four arguments. Now you know what the last two are called - but what are they used for?

The `context` argument is a JavaScript object that every resolver in the resolver chain can read from and write to - it thus basically is a means for resolvers to communicate. As you'll see in a bit, it's also possible to already write to it at the moment when the GraphQL server itself is being initialized. So, it's also a way for _you_ to pass arbitrary data or functions to the resolvers. In this case, you're going to attach this `db` object to the `context` - more about that soon.

The `info` object carries information about the incoming GraphQL query (in the form of a [query AST](https://medium.com/@cjoudrey/life-of-a-graphql-query-lexing-parsing-ca7c5045fad8)). For example, it knows what fields are being requested in the selection set of the query.

> **Note**: To learn more in-depth about the resolver arguments, read the following two articles:
> - [GraphQL Server Basics: The Schema](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e)
> - [GraphQL Server Basics: Demystifying the `info` Argument in GraphQL Resolvers](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-server-basics-demystifying-the-info-argument-in-graphql-resolvers-6f26249f613a)

Now that you have a basic understanding of the arguments that are passed into the resolver, let's see how they're being used inside the implementation of the resolver function.

#### Understanding the `feed` resolver

The `feed` resolver is implemented as follows:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/index.js"&nocopy)
feed: (root, args, context, info) => {
  return context.db.query.links({}, info)
},
```

It accesses a `db` object on `context`. As you will see in a bit, this `db` object actually is a `Prisma` binding instance from the [`prisma-binding`](https://github.com/graphcool/prisma-binding) NPM package.

This `Prisma` binding instance effectively turns the Prisma database schema into JavaScript functions which you can invoke. When invoking such a function, the `Prisma` binding instance will assemble a GraphQL query under the hood and send it to the Prisma API for you. But what are the two parameters you're passing to the function?

The first paramater carries any variables you might want to submit along with the query. Since you don't need any variables for the `links` query right now, it's just an empty object.

The second parameter is used by the `Prisma` binding instance to generate the _selection set_ for the query it sends to the Prisma API. You learned before that the `info` object carries information about the selection set of the incoming query. What's happening here is that you're basically _forwarding_ (i.e. [delegating](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-schema-stitching-explained-schema-delegation-4c6caf468405)) the incoming query to the Prisma engine. The `info` object needs to be passed along so that Prisma knows what fields are being requested in an incoming query.

In fact, the second argument could also be a _string_ containing a selection set for the query. Consider this exemplary function call:

```js(nocopy)
const selectionSet = `
{
  id
  description
  url
}
`
context.db.query.links({}, selectionSet)
```

This would correspond to the following GraphQL query being sent to the Prisma API:

```graphql(nocopy)
query {
  links {
    id
    description
    url
  }
}
```

#### Understanding the `post` resolver

The `post` resolver now looks like this:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/index.js"&nocopy)
post: (root, args, context, info) => {
  return context.db.mutation.createLink({
    data: {
      url: args.url,
      description: args.description,
    },
  }, info)
},
```

Similar to the `feed` resolver, you're simply invoking a function on the `Prisma` binding instance which is attached to the `context`.

Recall that the `Prisma` binding instance essentially translates the Prisma database schema into functions which you can invoke from JavaScript. Invoking these functions will send the corresponding query/mutation to the underlying Prisma API.

In this case, you're sending the `createLink` mutation from Prisma's GraphQL schema. As arguments, you're passing the data that the resolvers receive via the `args` parameter.

Again, the second argument to the function call is the `info` object which contains the selection set of the incoming mutation - and again, this _could_ be replaced by a string:

```js(nocopy)
const selectionSet = `
{
  id
}
`
context.db.mutation.createLink({
  data: {
    url: "www.prisma.io"
    description: "Prisma turns your database into a GraphQL API"
  }
}, selectionSet)
```

This would correspond to the following mutation being sent to the API:

```graphql(nocopy)
mutation {
  createLink(data: {
    url: "www.prisma.io"
    description: "Prisma turns your database into a GraphQL API"
  }) {
    id
  }
}
```

So, to summarize, Prisma bindings let you invoke functions that correspond to operations that are defined in the GraphQL schema. The functions have the same names as the operations and the same structure with respect to the arguments they receive and the values they return.

But, how do you make sure your resolvers actually get access to that magical and often-mentioned `Prisma` binding instance?

### Creating the `Prisma` binding instance

Before doing anything else, go ahead and do what JavaScript developers love most: Add a new dependency to your project 😑

<Instruction>

In the root directory of your project (not inside `database`), run the following command:

```bash(path=".../hackernews-node")
yarn add prisma-binding
```

</Instruction>

Cool! Now you can attach the `Prisma` binding instance to the `context` so that your resolvers get access to it.

<Instruction>

In `index.js`, update the instantiation of the `GraphQLServer` to look as follows (note that you need to replace the value for `endpoint` with your own Prisma endpoint!):

```js{4-12}(path=".../hackernews-node/src/index.js")
const server = new GraphQLServer({
  typeDefs: './src/schema.graphql',
  resolvers,
  context: req => ({
    ...req,
    db: new Prisma({
      typeDefs: 'src/generated/prisma.graphql',
      endpoint: 'https://eu1.prisma.sh/public-graytracker-771/hackernews-node/dev',
      secret: 'mysecret123',
      debug: true,
    }),
  }),
})
```

</Instruction>

So, here's the trick. You're instantiating `Prisma` with the following pieces of information:

- `typeDefs`: This points to the Prisma database schema which defines the full CRUD GraphQL API of Prisma. Note that you actually don't have this file yet - we'll tell you in a bit how to get it.
- `endpoint`: This is the endpoint of your Prisma API. Don't forget to replace it with the endpoint of your own Prisma service here!
- `secret`: Recall that all requests against the Prisma API need to be authenticated by including a JWT in the `Authorization` header of the HTTP request? This JWT needs to be signed with the `secret` defined in `prisma.yml`. As you're not making any _direct_ requests against the Prisma API, but these requests are being made for you by the `Prisma` binding instance, you need to tell it what that secret is so it can generate a JWT which it attaches to the requests.
- `debug`: Setting the `debug` flag to `true` means that all requests, made by the `Prisma` binding instance to the Prisma API will be logged to the console. It's a convenient way to observe the actual GraphQL queries and mutations that are sent to Prisma.

<Instruction>

Finally, to make this work you need to import `Prisma` into `index.js`. At the top of the file, add the following import statement:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/index.js")
const { Prisma } = require('prisma-binding')
```

</Instruction>

You're almost done! There's is only one piece left to the puzzle, and that's downloading the Prisma database schema which referenced in the `Prisma` constructor call.

### Downloading the Prisma database schema

There are various ways how to get access to the schema of a GraphQL API. In this tutorial. you'll use the [GraphQL CLI](https://github.com/graphql-cli/graphql-cli) in combination with [`graphql-config`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-config). This also leads with a few more improvements regarding your general workflows.

<Instruction>

First, create a `.graphqlconfig` file:

```bash(path=".../hackernews-node")
touch .graphqlconfig.yml
```

</Instruction>

This file is the major source of information for the GraphQL CLI.

<Instruction>

Add the following contents to `.graphqlconfig.yml`:

```yml(path=".../hackernews-node/.graphqlconfig.yml")
projects:
  app:
    schemaPath: src/schema.graphql
    extensions:
      endpoints:
        default: http://localhost:4000
  database:
    schemaPath: src/generated/prisma.graphql
    extensions:
      prisma: database/prisma.yml
```

</Instruction>

So, what's going on here? You're defining two `projects`. As you might guess, each project represents one of your GraphQL APIs - the application layer (`graphql-yoga`) and the database layer (Prisma).

For each project, you're specifying a `schemaPath`. This is simply the path to the GraphQL schema that defines each API.

For the `app` project, you're further specifying an `endpoint` which is the URL where the GraphQL server is running when it's started.

The `database` project on the other hand only points to the `prisma.yml` file. In fact, pointing to this file also provides information about the endpoint of the Prisma service, since all the information that's needed to compose the endpoint can be found in there.

There are two main benefits you now get from this setup:

- You can interact with both GraphQL APIs in a Playground side-by-side.
- When deploying the Prisma service with `prisma deploy`, the Prisma CLI downloads the generated Prisma database schema into the specified location.

The Prisma CLI also uses information that's provided in `.graphqlconfig.yml`. Therefore, you can now run `prisma` commands from the root directory rather than from the `database` directory.

<Instruction>

Inside the root directory of your project, run `prisma deploy` to download the Prisma database schema into location that's specified in `.graphqlconfig.yml`:

```bash(path=".../hackernews-node")
prisma deploy
```

</Instruction>

Observing the output of the command, you can see it prints the following line this time:

```(nocopy)
Writing database schema to `src/generated/prisma.graphql`  1ms
```

And voilà, there is the Prisma database schema in `src/generated/prisma.graphql` 😮

Okay, one last minor change before you can start and test the server!

<Instruction>

Open `src/schema.graphql` and delete the `Link` type.

</Instruction>

Ehm, what? Why would you do that? Where does the `Link` definition now come from that's used in the definition of the `feed` and `post` fields. Answer: You'll import it.

<Instruction>

Still in `src/schema.graphql`, add the following import statement to the top of the file:

```graphql(path=".../hackernews-node/src/schema.graphql")
# import Link from "./generated/prisma.graphql"
```

</Instruction>

This import syntax used here is not part of the official GraphQL specification ([yet!](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/master/notes/2018-02-01.md#present-graphql-import)). It comes from the [`graphql-import`](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-import) package which is being used by `graphql-yoga` to resolve any dependencies across `.graphql` files.

Note that in this case, it wouldn't actually make a difference if you left the `Link` type as it was. However, it is a lot more convenient to only define the `Link` type _once_ and then reuse that definition. Otherwise you'd have to update multiple definitions whenever you're changing the `Link` type.

Great, that's it! You can finally start the server now and test the API now!

### Accessing both GraphQL APIs inside the same Playground

Let's now look at how you can leverage the information in `.graphqlconfig.yml` to work with both GraphQL APIs side-by-side.

<Instruction>

First, go ahead and install the GraphQL CLI.:
`
```bash
yarn global add graphql-cli
```

</Instruction>

Now you can run the `graphql playground` command to open both APIs at once. Before that, you need to start the GraphQL server (otherwise the Playground for the `app` project won't work).

<Instruction>

Next, start the GraphQL server:

```bash(path=".../hackernews-node")
node src/index.js
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Now, open a new terminal tab (or window) and run the followign command to open both GraphQL APIs inside the same GraphQL Playground:

```bash(path="hackernews-node/")
graphql playground
```

</Instruction>

> **Note**: You can also download the [Desktop app](https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-playground/releases) of the GraphQL Playground instead of using it in the browser.

Here's what the Playground with both projects looks like:

![](https://imgur.com/uEPCMs5.png)

Using the left side-bar, you can now switch between the different projects and either send requests to the application layer or the database layer ✌️ ️

All right, that was _a lot_ of configuration and only very little coding! Let's change that and implement a few more features.
