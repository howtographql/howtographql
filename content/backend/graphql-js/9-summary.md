In this tutorial, you learned how to build a GraphQL server from scratch. The stack you used was based on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [`graphql-yoga`](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-yoga) and [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

`graphql-yoga` is a fast and simple GraphQL server library built on top of [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/). It comes with several features, such as out-of-the-box support for [GraphQL Playgrounds](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) and realtime GraphQL subscriptions.

The resolvers of your GraphQL server are implemented using the Prisma client that's responsible for database access.

If you want to dive deeper and become part of the awesome GraphQL community, here are a few resource and community recommendations for you:
