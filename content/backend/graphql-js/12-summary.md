description: "You learned how to build a GraphQL server with graphql-js, Node.js & MongoDB and best practices for filters, authentication, pagination and subscriptions."

In this tutorial you learned how to build your very own GraphQL server from scratch, using NodeJS and Express. By the end this server was capable of fetching and creating links, storing and fetching data from MongoDB, informing clients about new links in real time, authenticating users, filtering and paginating links, and much more.

Now that you already know all the basics, make sure to look deeper into anything that you're interested in learning more about. GraphQL is getting more and more popular, so there's tons of extra content out there for you to dive into. A few interesting ones, for example:

* [Launchpad](https://launchpad.graphql.com/). This is a cool playground that you can use to build a NodeJS GraphQL server very quickly, without having to manually setup everything yourself. It will run your server code in the cloud, letting you just focus on the resolvers. It's perfect for quickly testing something out, or sharing code with other people. It also allows you to download the full server code to your machine, so you can continue the development from there if you wish to.

* [Graphql-JS: The hidden features](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/graphql-js-the-hidden-features-effaca7a81b3). A very interesting blog post explaining a bit about some powerful tools from the [graphql-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql) npm package that not everyone knows about. In fact, many other articles from [Apollo](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/) would also be very useful, so make sure to take a look around there.
