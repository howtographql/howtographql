In this section, you're going to implement signup and login
functionality that allows your users to authenticate against
your GraphQL server.

### Adding a `User` model

The first thing you need is a way to represent user data in
the database. To do so, you can add a `User` type to your
Prisma data model.

You'll also want to add a _relation_ between the `User` and
the existing `Link` type to express that `Link`s are
_posted_ by `User`s.

<Instruction>

Open `prisma/schema.prisma` and add the following code,
making sure to also update your existing `Link` model
accordingly:

```graphql{6,10-16}(path=".../hackernews-node/prisma/data model.prisma")
model Link {
  id          Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  description String
  url         String
  postedBy    User?    @relation(fields: [postedById], references: [id])
  postedById  Int?
}

model User {
  id        Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  name      String
  email     String   @unique
  password  String
  links     Link[]
}
```

</Instruction>

Now we start to see even more how Prisma helps you to reason
about your data in a way that is more aligned with how it is
represented in the underlying database.

### Understanding relation fields

Notice how you're adding a new _relation field_ called
`postedBy` to the `Link` model that points to a `User`
instance. The `User` model then has a `links` field that's a
list of `Link`s.

To do this, we need to also define the relation by
annotating the `postedBy` field with
[the `@relation` attribute](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations#the-relation-attribute).
This is required for every relation field in your Prisma
schema, and all you're doing is defining what the foreign
key of the related table will be. So in this case, we're
adding an extra field to store the `id` of the `User` who
posts a `Link`, and then telling Prisma that `postedById`
will be equal to the `id` field in the `User` table.

If this is quite new to you, don't worry! We're going be
adding a few of these relational fields and you'll get the
hang of it as you go! For a deeper dive on relations with
Prisma, check out these
[docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-schema/relations).

### Updating Prisma Client

This is a great time to refresh your memory on the workflow
we described for your project at the end of chapter 4!

After every change you make to the data model, you need to
migrate your database and then re-generate Prisma Client.

<Instruction>

In the root directory of the project, run the following
command:

```bash(path=".../hackernews-node")
npx prisma migrate save --name "add-user-model" --experimental
```

</Instruction>

This command has now generated your second migration inside
of `prisma/migrations`, and you can start to see how this
becomes a historical record of how your database evolves
over time.

<Instruction>

Now it's time to apply that migration to your database:

```bash(path=".../hackernews-node")
npx prisma migrate up --experimental
```

</Instruction>

Your database structure should now be updated to reflect the
changes to your data model.

Finally, you need to re-generate PrismaClient.

<Instruction>

Run the following command:

```bash(path=".../hackernews-node")
npx prisma generate
```

</Instruction>

That might feel like a lot of steps, but the workflow will
become automatic by the end of this tutorial!

Your database is ready and Prisma Client is now updated to
expose all the CRUD queries for the newly added `User` model
– woohoo! 🎉

### Extending the GraphQL schema

Remember back when we were setting up your GraphQL server
and discussed the process of schema-driven development? It
all starts with extending your schema definition with the
new operations that you want to add to the API - in this
case a `signup` and `login` mutation.

<Instruction>

Open the application schema in `src/schema.graphql` and
update the `Mutation` type as follows:

```graphql{3,4}(path=".../hackernews-node/src/schema.graphql")
type Mutation {
  post(url: String!, description: String!): Link!
  signup(email: String!, password: String!, name: String!): AuthPayload
  login(email: String!, password: String!): AuthPayload
}
```

</Instruction>

Next, go ahead and add the `AuthPayload` along with a `User`
type definition to the file.

<Instruction>

Still in `src/schema.graphql`, add the following type
definitions:

```graphql(path=".../hackernews-node/src/schema.graphql")
type AuthPayload {
  token: String
  user: User
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  email: String!
  links: [Link!]!
}
```

</Instruction>

The `signup` and `login` mutations behave very similarly:
both return information about the `User` who's signing up
(or logging in) as well as a `token` which can be used to
authenticate subsequent requests against your GraphQL API.
This information is bundled in the `AuthPayload` type.

<Instruction>

Finally, you need to reflect that the relation between
`User` and `Link` should be bi-directional by adding the
`postedBy` field to the existing `Link` model definition in
`schema.graphql`:

```graphql{5}(path=".../hackernews-node/src/schema.graphql")
type Link {
  id: ID!
  description: String!
  url: String!
  postedBy: User
}
```

</Instruction>

### Implementing the resolver functions

After extending the schema definition with the new
operations, you need to implement resolver functions for
them. Before doing so, let's actually refactor your code a
bit to keep it more modular!

You'll pull out the resolvers for each type into their own
files.

<Instruction>

First, create a new directory called `resolvers` and add
four files to it: `Query.js`, `Mutation.js`, `User.js` and
`Link.js`. You can do so with the following commands:

```bash(path=".../hackernews-node")
mkdir src/resolvers
touch src/resolvers/Query.js
touch src/resolvers/Mutation.js
touch src/resolvers/User.js
touch src/resolvers/Link.js
```

</Instruction>

Next, move the implementation of the `feed` resolver into
`Query.js`.

<Instruction>

In `Query.js`, add the following function definition:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/resolvers/Query.js")
function feed(parent, args, context, info) {
  return context.prisma.link.findMany()
}

module.exports = {
  feed,
}
```

</Instruction>

This is pretty straighforward. You're just reimplementing
the same functionality from before with a dedicated function
in a different file. The `Mutation` resolvers are next.

#### Adding authentication resolvers

<Instruction>

Open `Mutation.js` and add the new `login` and `signup`
resolvers (you'll add the `post` resolver in a bit):

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/resolvers/Mutation.js")
async function signup(parent, args, context, info) {
  // 1
  const password = await bcrypt.hash(args.password, 10)

  // 2
  const user = await context.prisma.user.create({ data: { ...args, password } })

  // 3
  const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, APP_SECRET)

  // 4
  return {
    token,
    user,
  }
}

async function login(parent, args, context, info) {
  // 1
  const user = await context.prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { email: args.email } })
  if (!user) {
    throw new Error('No such user found')
  }

  // 2
  const valid = await bcrypt.compare(args.password, user.password)
  if (!valid) {
    throw new Error('Invalid password')
  }

  const token = jwt.sign({ userId: user.id }, APP_SECRET)

  // 3
  return {
    token,
    user,
  }
}

module.exports = {
  signup,
  login,
  post,
}
```

</Instruction>

Let's use the good ol' numbered comments again to understand
what's going on here – starting with `signup`.

1. In the `signup` mutation, the first thing to do is
   encrypt the `User`'s password using the `bcryptjs`
   library which you'll install soon.
1. The next step is to use your `PrismaClient` instance (via
   `prisma` as we covered in the steps about `context`) to
   store the new `User` record in the database.
1. You're then generating a JSON Web Token which is signed
   with an `APP_SECRET`. You still need to create this
   `APP_SECRET` and also install the `jwt` library that's
   used here.
1. Finally, you return the `token` and the `user` in an
   object that adheres to the shape of an `AuthPayload`
   object from your GraphQL schema.

Now on the `login` mutation!

1. Instead of _creating_ a new `User` object, you're now
   using your `PrismaClient` instance to retrieve an
   existing `User` record by the `email` address that was
   sent along as an argument in the `login` mutation. If no
   `User` with that email address was found, you're
   returning a corresponding error.
1. The next step is to compare the provided password with
   the one that is stored in the database. If the two don't
   match, you're returning an error as well.
1. In the end, you're returning `token` and `user` again.

Let's go and finish up the implementation.

<Instruction>

First, add the required dependencies to the project:

```bash(path=".../hackernews-node/")
npm install jsonwebtoken bcryptjs
```

</Instruction>

Next, you'll create a few utilities that are being reused in
a few places.

<Instruction>

Create a new file inside the `src` directory and call it
`utils.js`:

```bash(path=".../hackernews-node/")
touch src/utils.js
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Now, add the following code to it:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/utils.js")
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const APP_SECRET = 'GraphQL-is-aw3some';

function getTokenPayload(token) {
  return jwt.verify(token, APP_SECRET);
}

function getUserId(req, authToken) {
  if (req) {
    const authHeader = req.headers.authorization;
    if (authHeader) {
      const token = authHeader.replace('Bearer ', '');
      if (!token) {
        throw new Error('No token found');
      }
      const { userId } = getTokenPayload(token);
      return userId;
    }
  } else if (authToken) {
    const { userId } = getTokenPayload(authToken);
    return userId;
  }

  throw new Error('Not authenticated');
}

module.exports = {
  APP_SECRET,
  getUserId
};
```

</Instruction>

The `APP_SECRET` is used to sign the JWTs which you're
issuing for your users.

The `getUserId` function is a helper function that you'll
call in resolvers which require authentication (such as
`post`). It first retrieves the `Authorization` header
(which contains the `User`'s JWT) from the `context`. It
then verifies the JWT and retrieves the `User`'s ID from it.
Notice that if that process is not successful for any
reason, the function will throw an _exception_. You can
therefore use it to "protect" the resolvers which require
authentication.

<Instruction>

To make everything work, be sure to add the following import
statements to the top of `Mutation.js`:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/resolvers/Mutation.js")
const bcrypt = require('bcryptjs')
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken')
const { APP_SECRET, getUserId } = require('../utils')
```

</Instruction>

Right now, there's one more minor issue. You're accessing a
`request` object on the `context`. However, when
initializing the `context`, you're really only attaching the
`prisma` instance to it - there's no `request` object yet
that could be accessed.

<Instruction>

To make the above operations possible, open `index.js` and
adjust the instantiation of the `GraphQLServer` as follows:

```js{1,9,13-17}(path=".../hackernews-node/src/index.js")
const { getUserId } = require('./utils');

const server = new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs: fs.readFileSync(
    path.join(__dirname, 'schema.graphql'),
    'utf8'
  ),
  resolvers,
  context: ({ req }) => {
    return {
      ...req,
      prisma,
      userId:
        req && req.headers.authorization
          ? getUserId(req)
          : null
    };
  }
});
```

</Instruction>

Instead of attaching an object directly, you're now creating
the `context` as a function which _returns_ the `context`.
The advantage of this approach is that you can attach the
HTTP request that carries the incoming GraphQL query (or
mutation) to the `context` as well. This will allow your
resolvers to read the `Authorization` header and validate if
the user who submitted the request is eligible to perform
the requested operation.

### Requiring authentication for the `post` mutation

Before you're going to test your authentication flow, make
sure to complete your schema/resolver setup. Right now the
`post` resolver is still missing.

<Instruction>

In `Mutation.js`, add the following resolver implementation
for `post`:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/resolvers/Mutation.js")
async function post(parent, args, context, info) {
  const { userId } = context;

  return await context.prisma.link.create({
    data: {
      url: args.url,
      description: args.description,
      postedBy: { connect: { id: userId } },
    }
  })
}
```

</Instruction>

Two things have changed in the implementation compared to
the previous implementation in `index.js`:

1. You're now using the `getUserId` function to retrieve the
   ID of the `User`. This ID is stored in the JWT that's set
   at the `Authorization` header of the incoming HTTP
   request. Therefore, you know which `User` is creating the
   `Link` here. Recall that an unsuccessful retrieval of the
   `userId` will lead to an exception and the function scope
   is exited before the `createLink` mutation is invoked. In
   that case, the GraphQL response will just contain an
   error indicating that the user was not authenticated.
1. You're then also using that `userId` to _connect_ the
   `Link` to be created with the `User` who is creating it.
   This is happening through a
   [nested write](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/relation-queries#nested-writes).

#### Resolving relations

There's one more thing you need to do before you can launch
the GraphQL server again and test the new functionality:
ensuring the relation between `User` and `Link` gets
properly resolved.

Notice how we've omitted all resolvers for _scalar_ values
from the `User` and `Link` types? These are following the
simple pattern that we saw at the beginning of the tutorial:

```(nocopy)
Link: {
  id: parent => parent.id,
  url: parent => parent.url,
  description: parent => parent.description,
}
```

However, we've now added two fields to our GraphQL schema
that can _not_ be resolved in the same way: `postedBy` on
`Link` and `links` on `User`. The resolvers for these fields
need to be explicitly implemented because our GraphQL server
can not infer where to get that data from.

<Instruction>

To resolve the `postedBy` relation, open `Link.js` and add
the following code to it:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/resolvers/Link.js")
function postedBy(parent, args, context) {
  return context.prisma.link.findUnique({ where: { id: parent.id } }).postedBy()
}

module.exports = {
  postedBy,
}
```

</Instruction>

In the `postedBy` resolver, you're first fetching the `Link`
from the database using the `prisma` instance and then
invoke `postedBy` on it. Notice that the resolver needs to
be called `postedBy` because it resolves the `postedBy`
field from the `Link` type in `schema.graphql`.

You can resolve the `links` relation in a similar way.

<Instruction>

Open `User.js` and add the following code to it:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/resolvers/User.js")
function links(parent, args, context) {
  return context.prisma.user.findUnique({ where: { id: parent.id } }).links()
}

module.exports = {
  links,
}
```

</Instruction>

#### Putting it all together

Awesome! The last thing you need to do now is use the new
resolver implementations in `index.js`.

<Instruction>

Open `index.js` and import the modules which now contain the
resolvers at the top of the file:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/index.js")
const Query = require('./resolvers/Query')
const Mutation = require('./resolvers/Mutation')
const User = require('./resolvers/User')
const Link = require('./resolvers/Link')
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Then, update the definition of the `resolvers` object to
looks as follows:

```js(path=".../hackernews-node/src/index.js")
const resolvers = {
  Query,
  Mutation,
  User,
  Link
}
```

</Instruction>

That's it, you're ready to test the authentication flow! 🔓

### Testing the authentication flow

The very first thing you'll do is test the `signup` mutation
and thereby create a new `User` in the database.

<Instruction>

If you haven't done so already, stop and restart the server
by first killing it with **CTRL+C**, then run
`node src/index.js`. Afterwards, navigate to
`http://localhost:4000` where the GraphQL Playground is
running.

</Instruction>

Note that you can "reuse" your Playground from before if you
still have it open - it's only important that you restart
the server so the changes you made to the implementation are
actually applied.

<Instruction>

Now, send the following mutation to create a new `User`:

```graphql
mutation {
  signup(
    name: "Alice"
    email: "alice@prisma.io"
    password: "graphql"
  ) {
    token
    user {
      id
    }
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

From the server's response, copy the authentication `token`
and open another tab in the Playground. Inside that new tab,
open the **HTTP HEADERS** pane in the bottom-left corner and
specify the `Authorization` header - similar to what you did
with the Prisma Playground before. Replace the `__TOKEN__`
placeholder in the following snippet with the copied token:

```json
{
  "Authorization": "Bearer __TOKEN__"
}
```

</Instruction>

Whenever you're now sending a query/mutation from that tab,
it will carry the authentication token.

<Instruction>

With the `Authorization` header in place, send the following
to your GraphQL server:

```graphql
mutation {
  post(
    url: "www.graphqlconf.org"
    description: "An awesome GraphQL conference"
  ) {
    id
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

![](https://imgur.com/V1hp4ID.png)

When your server receives this mutation, it invokes the
`post` resolver and therefore validates the provided JWT.
Additionally, the new `Link` that was created is now
connected to the `User` for which you previously sent the
`signup` mutation.

To verify everything worked, you can send the following
`login` mutation:

```graphql
mutation {
  login(email: "alice@prisma.io", password: "graphql") {
    token
    user {
      email
      links {
        url
        description
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This will return a response similar to this:

```json(nocopy)
{
  "data": {
    "login": {
      "token": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1c2VySWQiOiJjanBzaHVsazJoM3lqMDk0NzZzd2JrOHVnIiwiaWF0IjoxNTQ1MDYyNTQyfQ.KjGZTxr1jyJH7HcT_0glRInBef37OKCTDl0tZzogekw",
      "user": {
        "email": "alice@prisma.io",
        "links": [
          {
            "url": "www.graphqlconf.org",
            "description": "An awesome GraphQL conference"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```
