We hope this example shows a taste of the power of GraphQL and how Lighthouse makes it easy to build your own server with Laravel. 

The app you just build might use some more features. Here are a few ideas on what you might add
to learn more about Lighthouse.

- Add pagination to your fields
- Create and update posts and comments
- Validate the inputs that are sent to your server

If you liked this tutorial go through the oficial docs to learn more about Lighthouse package at https://github.com/nuwave/lighthouse .
