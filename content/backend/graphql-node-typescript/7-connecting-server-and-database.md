In this section, you're going to learn how to connect your GraphQL server to your database using [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io), which provides the interface to your database. This connection is implemented via [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client).

### Wiring up your GraphQL schema with Prisma Client

The first thing you need to do is import your generated Prisma Client library and wire up the GraphQL server so that you can access the database queries that your new Prisma Client exposes.

#### The GraphQL `context` resolver argument

Remember how we said earlier that all GraphQL resolver functions _always_ receive four arguments? To accomplish this step, you'll need to get to know another one â€“ the `context` argument!

The `context` argument is a plain JavaScript object that every resolver in the resolver chain can read from and write to. Thus, it is basically a means for resolvers to communicate. A really helpful
feature is that you can already write to the `context` at the moment when the GraphQL server itself is being initialized.

This means that you can attach an instance of Prisma Client to the `context` when initializing the server and then access it from inside our resolvers via the `context` argument!

That's all a bit theoretical, so let's see how it looks in action ðŸ’»

You'll start by creating a new file called `src/context.ts` to handle our GraphQL `context` creation.

<Instruction>

Create the new file, with the following content: 

```typescript{1-3}(path="hackernews-node-ts/src/context.ts)
export async function contextFactory() {
  return {};
}
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

Now, you'll need to import the `contextFactory` function and make sure you add it as part of the GraphQL execution process:

```typescript{2,9}(path="hackernews-node-ts/src/index.ts)
// ... other imports ...
import { contextFactory } from "./context";

// In your Helix handler, add:
const result = await processRequest({
  request,
  schema,
  operationName,
  contextFactory,
  query,
  variables,
});
```

</Instruction>

In the next step, you'll connect the Prisma client and your GraphQL server!

### Updating the resolver functions to use Prisma Client

<Instruction>

You'll start by importing `PrismaClient` into `src/context.ts` at the top of the file, created a global connection, and make it available as part of your GraphQL `context`.

Also, modify the GraphQL execution and add our `prisma` connection to the GraphQL execution `context`:

```typescript{1,3,5-7,11}(path="hackernews-node-ts/src/context.ts)
import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export type GraphQLContext = {
  prisma: PrismaClient;
};

export async function contextFactory(): Promise<GraphQLContext> {
  return {
    prisma,
  };
}
```

</Instruction>

Awesome! This will make the `prisma` object available for us during the execution of our `resolvers`.

Now, the `context` object that's passed into all your GraphQL resolvers is being initialized right here and because you're attaching an instance of `PrismaClient` (as `prisma`) to it when the GraphQL server is instantiated, you'll now be able to access `context.prisma` in all of your resolvers.

To get the most out of the TypeScript language, you also created a `GraphQLContext` type to have strict validation, and to make it easier to type the resolvers later.

This TypeScript type `GraphQLContext` will represent the structure of the GraphQL `context`, and will help us to get better type-safety and auto-complete for the Prisma SDK.

Finally, it's time to refactor the GraphQL resolvers. Again, we encourage you to type these changes yourself so that you can get used to Prisma's autocompletion and how to leverage that to intuitively figure out what resolvers should be on your own.

<Instruction>

Open `src/schema.ts` and remove the `links` array entirely, as well as the `idCount` variable â€“ you don't need those any more since the data will now be stored in an actual database. You can also remove `type Link`, because we'll replace it with the type generated by Prisma soon.

</Instruction>

Next, you need to update the implementation of the resolver functions because they're still accessing the variables that were just deleted. Plus, you now want to return actual data from the database instead of local dummy data.

<Instruction>

In `src/schema.ts`, update the `resolvers` object and change imports to look as follows:

```typescript{2,4,9-11,19-31}(path="hackernews-node-ts/src/schema.ts)
import { makeExecutableSchema } from "@graphql-tools/schema";
import { GraphQLContext } from "./context";
import typeDefs from "./schema.graphql";
import { Link } from "@prisma/client";

const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    info: () => `This is the API of a Hackernews Clone`,
    feed: async (parent: unknown, args: {}, context: GraphQLContext) => {
      return context.prisma.link.findMany();
    },
  },
  Link: {
    id: (parent: Link) => parent.id,
    description: (parent: Link) => parent.description,
    url: (parent: Link) => parent.url,
  },
  Mutation: {
    post: (
      parent: unknown,
      args: { description: string; url: string },
      context: GraphQLContext
    ) => {
      const newLink = context.prisma.link.create({
        data: {
          url: args.url,
          description: args.description,
        },
      });
      return newLink;
    },
  },
};

export const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
});

```

> Notice that the code is changed now, and the `Link` type is being imported from the Prisma client instead of being hand-written. 

</Instruction>

Now let's understand how these new resolvers are working!

#### Understanding the `feed` resolver

The `feed` resolver is implemented as follows:

```typescript{4,6}(nocopy)
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    // ...
    feed: async (parent: unknown, args: {}, context: GraphQLContext) => {
      return context.prisma.link.findMany();
    },
  },
  // ...
}
```

It accesses the `prisma` object via the `context` argument we discussed a moment ago. As a reminder, this is actually an entire `PrismaClient` instance that's imported from the generated `@prisma/client` library, effectively allowing you to access your database through the Prisma Client API you set up in chapter 4.

Now, you should be able to imagine the complete system and workflow of a Prisma/GraphQL project, where our Prisma Client API exposes a number of database queries that let you read and write data in the database.

#### Understanding the `post` resolver

The `post` resolver now looks like this:

```typescript{3,15}(nocopy)
const resolvers = {
  Mutation: {
    post: async (
      parent: unknown,
      args: { description: string; url: string },
      context: GraphQLContext
    ) => {
      const newLink = await context.prisma.link.create({
        data: {
          url: args.url,
          description: args.description,
        },
      });
      return newLink;
    },
  },
};
```

Similar to the `feed` resolver, you're simply invoking a function on the `PrismaClient` instance which is attached to the `context`.

You're calling the `create` method on a `link` from your Prisma Client API. As arguments, you're passing the data that the resolvers receive via the `args` parameter.

So, to summarize, Prisma Client exposes a CRUD API for the models in your datamodel for you to read and write in your database. These methods are auto-generated based on your model definitions in
`schema.prisma`.

You may also have noticed that ```newLink``` is an object of type ```Promise```. This is because all Prisma CRUD operations are asynchronous. This is not a problem as Fastify Server is capable of detecting, and automatically resolving any ```Promise``` object that is returned from resolver functions. 

### Testing the new implementation

With these code changes, you can now go ahead and test if the new implementation with a database works as expected. As usual, run the following command in your terminal to start the GraphQL server (`npm run dev`, or `npm start`)

Then, open GraphiQL at `http://localhost:3000/playground`. You can send the same `feed` query and `post` mutation as before. However, the difference is that this time the submitted links will be
persisted in your SQLite database. Therefore, if you restart the server, the `feed` query will keep returning the same links.

<Instruction>

Open GraphiQL and try to run the `feed` query and the `post` mutation:

```graphql
query {
  feed {
    id
    url
    description
  }
}
```

```graphql
mutation {
  post(url: "www.prisma.io", description: "Prisma replaces traditional ORMs") {
    id
  }
}
```

</Instruction>

### Exploring your data in Prisma Studio

Prisma ships with a powerful database GUI where you can interact with your data: [Prisma Studio](https://github.com/prisma/studio).

Prisma Studio is different from a typical database GUI (such as [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)) in that it provides a layer of abstraction which allows you to see your data represented as it is in your Prisma data model.

This is one of the several ways that Prisma bridges the gap between how you structure and interact with your data in your application and how it is actually structured and represented in the
underlying database. One major benefit of this is that it helps you to build intuition and understanding of these two linked but separate layers over time.

Let's run Prisma Studio and see it in action!

<Instruction>

Run the following command in your terminal

```bash
npx prisma studio
```

</Instruction>

Running the command should open a tab in your browser automatically (running on `http://localhost:5555`) where you will see the following interface. Notice that you see a tab for your `Link` model and can also explore all models by hovering on the far left menu:
