### What are you going to build?
In this tutorial, you are going to create a [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com) clone using Django and Graphene. The platform will have the following features:

* List of Users and Links
* Users creation and authentication
* Users can create Links and vote on them

### Creating your local environment
Before starting, make sure you have Python 3.6 installed. If not, you can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). The installation is pretty straightforward on any supported operating system.

When working with Python, you will use *Virtual Environment*: a tool for keeping all the project's dependencies isolated from your system â€“ or other projects.

<Instruction>

On the terminal, create a new virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python3.6 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

</Instruction>

You'll notice your prompt changed to `(venv) ...`. It means you are *inside* your virtual environment, every Python package will be installed there. If you want to leave it, just type `deactivate`. Make sure to *always* have the virtual environment activated.

### Installing Django and Graphene 
The tool used to manage Python packages is `pip`, which should be available with your Python installation.

<Instruction>

With the virtual environment activated, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install django graphene graphene-django django-filter
django-admin startproject hackernews
cd hackernews
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

</Instruction>

Don't worry about the `hackernews/hackernews` structure, this is just the way Django works!

The commands above will install the necessary libraries, create a new Django project, create the base Django tables and start its builtin web server. To test it, open your browser and access the `http://localhost:8000` address. You should see the following page:

### Configuring Graphene Django

<Instruction>

On the `hackernews/settings.py` file, search for the `INSTALLED_APPS` variable and add the following:

```python(path=".../graphql-python/hackernews/hackernews/settings.py")
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # After the default packages
    'graphene_django',
)
```

</Instruction>

<Instruction>

And add following at the bottom of the file:

```python(path=".../graphql-python/hackernews/hackernews/settings.py")
GRAPHENE = {
    'SCHEMA': 'hackernews.schema.schema',
}
```

</Instruction>
