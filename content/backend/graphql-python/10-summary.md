Congratulations, you've reached the end of the Python GraphQL tutorial! Here, you've learned about the most used Python library for developing a GraphQL server – [Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/) – together with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Graphene-Django](http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/).

Implementing a Hackernews clone, you were able to go from a simple query to creating an awesome Relay structure. As you noticed, GraphQL is changing how clients and servers communicate and exchange data. Even being a young technology, it is already being adopted by big players, such as [GitHub](https://developer.github.com/v4/).

If you want to go deeper into GraphQL, here are some must click links:

* [Learn GraphQL](http://graphql.org/learn/) - learn about GraphQL, how it works, and how to use it.
* [GraphQL Weekly](https://graphqlweekly.com/) - sign up for an amazing weekly email about GraphQL.
* [Lessons from 4 Years of GraphQL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVNrqo9XGOs) - how GraphQL has evolved inside Facebook.
* [GraphQL Relay Specification](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/graphql-server-specification/) - title self descriptive.
