In this tutorial, you learned how to build a GraphQL server from scratch. The stack you used was based on
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
[Apollo-server](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/tree/main/packages/apollo-server), [Nexus](https://nexusjs.org/) and
[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/).

`apollo-server` is a fast and simple GraphQL server library. It comes with several features, such as a web based GraphQL Client.

The resolvers of your GraphQL server are implemented using Prisma Client which is responsible for database access.

If you want to dive deeper and become part of the awesome GraphQL community, here are a few resource and community
recommendations for you:

- [Prisma Blog](https://prisma.io/blog): The blog regularly features new and interesting content about GraphQL and Prisma, from
  community news to technical deep dives and various tutorials.
- [GraphQL Weekly](https://graphqlweekly.com): A weekly GraphQL newsletter with news from the GraphQL ecosystem
- [GraphQL Conf](https://www.graphqlconf.org): The world's biggest gathering of GraphQL enthusiasts happening in the
  heart of Berlin
- [Prisma Slack](https://slack.prisma.io): A Slack team with vivid discussions around everything GraphQL & Prisma

Congratulations on completing the tutorial! We can't wait to see what you build.
