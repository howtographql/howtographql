## Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

[**Go**](https://golang.org/) is a modern general purpose programming language
designed by google; best known for it's simplicity, concurrency and fast
performance. It's being used by big players in the industry like Google, Docker,
Lyft and Uber. If you are new to golang you can start from
[golang tour](https://tour.golang.org/) to learn fundamentals.

[**gqlgen**](https://gqlgen.com/) is a library for creating GraphQL applications
in Go.

In this tutorial we Implement a Hackernews GraphQL API clone with _golang_ and
_gqlgen_ and learn about GraphQL fundamentals along the way. Source code and
also this tutorial are available on Github at:

## What is a GraphQL server? <a name="what-is-a-graphql-server"></a>

A GraphQL server is able to receive requests in GraphQL Query Language format
and return response in desired form. GraphQL is a query language for API so you
can send queries and ask for what you need and exactly get that piece of data.
In this sample query we are looking for address, title of the links and name of
the user who add it:

```
query {
	links{
    	title
    	address,
    	user{
      		name
    	}
  	}
}
```

response:

```
{
  "data": {
    "links": [
      {
        "title": "our dummy link",
        "address": "https://address.org",
        "user": {
          "name": "admin"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Schema-Driven Development <a name="schema-driven-development"></a>

In GraphQL your API starts with a schema that defines all your types, queries
and mutations, It helps others to understand your API. So it's like a contract
between server and the client. Whenever you need to add a new capability to a
GraphQL API you must redefine schema file and then implement that part in your
code. GraphQL has its
[Schema Definition Language](http://graphql.org/learn/schema/) for this purpose.
gqlgen is a Go library for building GraphQL servers and has a nice feature that
generates code based on your schema definition.
