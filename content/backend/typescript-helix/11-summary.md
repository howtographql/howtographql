  'You learned how to build a GraphQL server with Node.js and best practices for filters, authentication and pagination'

In this tutorial, you learned how to build a GraphQL server from scratch. The stack you used was based on
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [`fastify`](https://www.fastify.io/), TypeScript and [`graphql-helix`](https://github.com/contrawork/graphql-helix).

The resolvers of your GraphQL server are implemented using Prisma Client which is responsible for database access.

Congratulations on completing the tutorial! We can't wait to see what you build.
