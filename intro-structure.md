    - codegen
- GraphQL Concepts: Advanced
    - Schema (directives, input types, argument types, union)
    - Fragments
    - Variables
    - Aliases
    
- Community
    - open spec
    - GraphQL conferences / meetups / content...

- standalone Playgrounds
- include GraphQL Playgrounds with ovefview of data (table / data browser)
