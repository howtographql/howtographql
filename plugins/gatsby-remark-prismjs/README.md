# gatsby-remark-prismjs

Adds syntax highlighting to code blocks in markdown files using
[PrismJS](http://prismjs.com/).

## Install

`npm install --save gatsby-remark-prismjs`

## How to use

```javascript
// In your gatsby-config.js
plugins: [
  {
    resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
    options: {
      plugins: [
        `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
      ]
    }
  }
]
```

### Include CSS

#### Required: Pick a PrismJS theme or create your own

PrismJS ships with a number of [themes][5] (previewable on the
[PrismJS website][6]) that you can easily include in your Gatsby
site, or you can build your own by copying and modifying an example
(which is what we've done for [gatsbyjs.org](https://gatsbyjs.org)).

To load a theme, just require its CSS file in your `layouts/index.js` file,
e.g.

```javascript
// layouts/index.js
require('prismjs/themes/prism-solarizedlight.css')
```

#### Optional: Add line highlighting styles

If you want to highlight lines of code, you also need to add some additional
CSS that targets our _custom line highlighting implementation_ (which slightly
differs from PrismJS's own plugin for that – more on that later).

For simple line highlights similar to PrismJS's, try:

```css
.gatsby-highlight-code-line {
  background-color: #feb;
  display: block;
  margin-right: -1em;
  margin-left: -1em;
  padding-right: 1em;
  padding-left: 0.75em;
  border-left: 0.25em solid #f99;
}
```

This should work out quite nicely for the "Solarized Light" PrismJS theme we
just added in the previous part. However, you will notice that when a
highlighted line runs wider than the surrounding code block container (causing a
horizontal scrollbar), its background won't be drawn for the initially hidden,
overflowing part. :(

We saw others fix that problem and decided to do so, too.
Just add the following CSS along your PrismJS theme and the styles for
`.gatsby-highlight-code-line`:

```css
/**
 * Add back the container background-color, border-radius, padding, margin
 * and overflow that we removed from <pre>.
 */
.gatsby-highlight {
  background-color: #fdf6e3;
  border-radius: 0.3em;
  margin: .5em 0;
  padding: 1em;
  overflow: auto;
}

/**
 * Remove the default PrismJS theme background-color, border-radius, margin,
 * padding and overflow.
 * 1. Make the element just wide enough to fit its content.
 * 2. Always fill the visible space in .gatsby-highlight.
 */
.gatsby-highlight pre[class*="language-"] {
  background-color: transparent;
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  overflow: initial;
  float: left; /* 1 */
  min-width: 100%; /* 2 */
}
```

### Usage in Markdown

    This is some beautiful code:

    ```javascript
    // In your gatsby-config.js
    plugins: [
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
        options: {
          plugins: [
            `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

    You can also add line highlighting. It adds a span around lines of
    code with a special class `.gatsby-highlight-code-line` that you can
    target with styles. See this readme for more info.

    In the following code snippet, lines 1 and 4 through 6 will get
    the line highlighting. The line range parsing is done with
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse-numeric-range.

    ```javascript{1,4-6}
    // In your gatsby-config.js
    plugins: [
      {
        resolve: `gatsby-transformer-remark`,
        options: {
          plugins: [
            `gatsby-remark-prismjs`,
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
    ```

## Implementation notes

### Line highlighting

Please note that we do _not_ use PrismJS's [line highlighting
plugin](http://prismjs.com/plugins/line-highlight/). Here's why:

* [PrismJS plugins][3] assume you're running
  things client side, but we are _build-time folks_.
* PrismJS's line highlighting plugin [implementation][1] does not allow
  for solid background colors or 100% wide backgrounds that are
  drawn beyond the _visible part_ of the container when content is overflowing.

Our approach follows the [Pygments-based][2] implementation of the
[React Tutorial/Documentation][4] for line highlights:

* It uses a wrapper element `<div class="gatsby-highlight">` around the
  PrismJS-formatted `<pre><code>`-blocks.`.
* Highlighted lines are wrapped in `<span class="gatsby-highlight-code-line">`.
* We insert a linebreak before the closing tag of `.gatsby-highlight-code-line`
  so it ends up at the start of the following line.

With all of this in place, we can apply `float:left; min-width:100%` to `<pre>`,
throw our overflow and background on `.gatsby-highlight`, and use
`display:block` on `.gatsby-highlight-code-line` – all of this coming together
to facilitate the desired line highlight behavior.
